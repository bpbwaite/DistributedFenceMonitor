> Types shall follow MISRA standard where possible to remove ambiguity
> Variable names must be unique and descriptive of its purpose
    > cannot be a keyword
    > should not overlap with those in the STL
    > variable names cannot begin with an underscore
    > names should be between 3 and 31 characters in length
> Make use of the proper capitalization
    > built in types and functions are camelCase
    > names and instances of structs and classes are Pascalcase
> Make use of only this Hungarian notation:
    > g_, for global variables
    > sz, for null terminated strings
    > postfix units with an underscore on variables with units
> Defines and constants must be all capitals
    > use underscores to separate words
> Module names (includes) must be all lowercase
