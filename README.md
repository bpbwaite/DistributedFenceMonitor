# DistributedFenceMonitor
Repository for the Distributed Fence Monitor Capstone

- The source files you should edit are src/dfm_mkr1310.cpp OR src/dfm_nanorp2040.cpp, for the two potential microcontrollers. 
"main.cpp" is set up so that platformIO can compile and upload the two sources separately, so don't edit without permission.

- As we build our own classes and functions, we must place them in a library in lib. There is a special folder structure to follow.
