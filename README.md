*In Association with ICARUS and ERP.*

## How to Use

- The node source file is 'src/dfm_mkr1310.cpp'.
- The central-node source file is 'src/dfm_recv_mkr1310.cpp'.
- The central server file is 'interpreter/dfm_recv.m'
- The "main.cpp" is set up so that PlatformIO can compile and upload multiple sources separately, depending on the environment.
